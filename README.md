# Project_Python_Flask_Bootstrap


 I'm a begginer programmer and that's my first project with Python/Flask/Bootstrap. It's a basic and simple Blog, with the possibilities of EDIT and DELETE. It helped me to achieve the basics concepts of back-end, the area that I'm focusing and studying more. That project was created with the help of the course which the link is right above and I give all the credits to them.

A couple things were added by me, but just smallest things. The concept and the content was all teached by the course and reproduced by me in those files.
Thanks for all that's checking that project and I hope it will help you to achieve what you are searching for.
